As others have pointed out, XFS filesystem cannot be shrunk.

So your best bet is to backup /home, remove and recreate its volume in a smaller size and give the rest to your /root volume just as Koen van der Rijt outlined in his post.


• backup the contents of /home

> tar -czvf /root/home.tgz -C /home . ; tar -tvf /root/home.tgz
• test the backup

> tar -tvf /root/home.tgz
• unmount home

> umount /dev/mapper/centos-home ;
> umount /dev/mapper/centos-home ;

• remove the home logical volume

> 
• recreate a new 400GB logical volume for /home, format and mount it

> lvcreate -L 1GB -n home centos
> mkfs.xfs /dev/centos/home
> mount /dev/mapper/centos-home
• extend your /root volume with ALL of the remaining space and resize (-r) the file system while doing so

> lvextend -r -l +100%FREE /dev/mapper/centos-root
• restore your backup

> tar -xzvf /root/home.tgz -C /home
• check /etc/fstab for any mapping of /home volume. IF it is using UUID you should update the UUID portion. (Since we created a new volume, UUID has changed)
